# Concept
- DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.
# Tools in DevOps
### Git (Version Control Tool)
- keep track of all the changes
- easy to return to and use the previous versions of the code.
### Maven (Build Tool)
- It is more than just an automation build framework
- It is also designed to manage reporting, documentation, distribution, releases and dependencies processes.
- It can build and manage projects written in Java, C#, Ruby, Scala and other languages using project object model (POM) plugins.
### Jenkins (Continuous Integration Tool)
- It is designed for both internal and plugin extensions. 
- Jenkins is an open-source Java-based automation CI server that is supported by multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and other Unix OSs. Jenkins can also be deployed on cloud-based platforms. 
- It is designed to support distributed workflows for accelerated and transparent builds, tests, and deployments across platforms.
- Some alternative tools:
    1. GitLab CI/CD
    2. Atlassian Bamboo
    3. CircleCI
    4. AWS CodePipeline
### Chef, Puppet, Ansible (Configuration Management Tool)
### Docker (Container Platforms)
- The Docker engine is designed to automate the development, deployment, and management of containerized applications on single nodes. 
- Docker is open-source and compatible with cloud services like AWS, GCP, and Azure Cloud. Docker also runs on Windows and Linux operating systems. 
### Kubernetes (Container Platforms)
- Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an automation orchestration platform that enables developers to run containerized applications across Kubernetes clusters referring to a group of nodes. 
- Developers harness Kubernetes to automate such processes as container configuration, scaling, networking, security, and more to achieve speed and efficiency in production. 
### Cloud Computing and Storage
### SignalFx (Monitoring, Alerting, and Incident Response Tools)
### Selenium (Testing Tool)
### Servicenow (IT Ticketing)
### ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana)
- ELK is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing log data. It can help you troubleshoot issues, identify trends, and gain insights into your system. 
- ELK is made up of three main components: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. 
- Elasticsearch is a search engine and database that stores log data. 
- Logstash is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from various sources, transforms it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch. 
- Kibana is a visual interface for exploring and analyzing data in Elasticsearch. 
- ELK can be used to monitor a variety of systems and applications, including web servers, application servers, databases, and more. 
- It is also highly scalable, so it can be used to manage log data from a small number of servers to a large, distributed system.
