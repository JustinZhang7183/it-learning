# Manifesto for Agile Software Development
- **Individuals and interactions** over **processes and tools**
- **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change** over **following a plan**
# Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
# Different Agile frameworks
### Scrum
###### Scrum team
- **Scrum Master**
    1. helps the Scrum Team:
        1. By coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
        2. Focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done
        3. Influence the removal of impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress
        4. Ensure that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.
    2. helps the Product Owner:
        1. Find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management
        2. Provide ways for the Scrum Team to understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
        3. Establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
        4. Facilitate stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed
    3. supports the Organization:
        1. By Leading, training and coaching them in their Scrum adoption
        2. By helping employees and stakeholders understand and instill an empirical approach for complex work
        3. Remove barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams
- **Product Owner**
    1. Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
    2. Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items
    3. Ordering Product Backlog Items
    4. Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood
- **Developers**
    1. Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog
    2. Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done
    3. Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal
    4. Holding each other accountable as professionals
###### Scrum Event
- **Sprints**: are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value. The Sprint is the Scrum event that encompasses all of the other Scrum events.
    1. **Sprint Planning**: Why is this Sprint valuable? What can be Done this Sprint? How will the chosen work get done?
    2. **Daily Scrum**: the purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
    3. **Sprint Review**: the purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
    4. **Sprint Retrospective**: the purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
###### Scrum Artifacts
- Product Backlog
    1. an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product
- Product Goal
    1. the commitment of the Product Backlog
    2. describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.
- Sprint Backlog
    1. a plan by and for the Developers
    2. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. 
- Sprint Goal
    1. the commitment of the Sprint Backlog
    2. The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.
    3. creates cohesiveness and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together 
- Increment
    1. an Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
    2. Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review
- Definition of Done
    1. The Definition of Done is the commitment by the Developers for the Increment, much like the Sprint Goal is the commitment by the Developers for the Sprint Backlog and the Product Goal is the commitment by the Product Owner for the Product Backlog.
